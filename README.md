# ROOT 6 pkgbuild for Arch Linux
My (revised and heavily commented) version of the pkgbuild on [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/root) to build and package ROOT on Arch Linux. 

The changes, with respect to the package on AUR, concern proper support of PyRoot and Pythia, other than solve the problem with the new GCC 5.1 ABI.
